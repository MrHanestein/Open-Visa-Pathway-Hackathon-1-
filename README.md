# Open-Visa-Pathway – Mobility Copilot for Global Students emigration

## 1. Problem

Nigerian and Indian international students who want to study in the UK/Canada/USA face confusing, misleading, and disorganized information
about visas, timelines, and post-study options.

## 2. Solution

OpenPath is an AI mobility copilot that turns this distressing process into a clear roadmap:
- Wizard → personalized roadmap (phases, checklist, risks)
- Doc explainer → plain-English summaries of visa emails/requirements
- Collab helper → draft emails/messages and time windows for cross-border calls

**Primary corridors (v1):**
- Nigeria → UK (Student → Graduate Route → Skilled Worker)
- India → UK (Student → Graduate Route → Skilled Worker)

## 3. Tech stack

- Python + Streamlit for UI
- OpenAI API (LLMs) for reasoning and generation
- (Later) Chroma/FAISS for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

## 4. Project status

- [ ] Streamlit app skeleton
- [ ] OpenAI integration
- [ ] Basic roadmap flow
- [ ] Doc explainer
- [ ] Collab helper

## 5. How to run (will be updated)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

```
